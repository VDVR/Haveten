<p><b><h4>Introduction</h4></b></p><br>
<p>Picture this: It’s the early 90s in India, a time of big changes 
and even bigger dreams. The country is shaking off its old ways and 
stepping into a new era of economic freedom. And right in the middle 
of all this, the Indian stock market is on a wild ride. The BSE 
Sensex, a measure of the stock market’s health, is climbing like 
never before, going from 1,194 points in January 1991 to a whopping 
4,467 points by April 1992. But this isn’t just about numbers and 
policies. This is also the story of Harshad Mehta, a man whose 
cunning moves shook the market and left a lasting impact.</p>
<p><b><h4>Setting the Stage - India in the Early 90s </h4></b><br>
<p><b>The Challenges Before the Change : </b>Rewind to the late 80s. 
India is wrestling with a bunch of economic problems. There are too 
many rules holding businesses back, policies that keep foreign goods 
out, and a growing government debt. </p>
<p><b>The Winds of Change - Economic Reforms :</b>Enter Dr. Manmohan 
Singh, the new Finance Minister in 1991. He’s got a vision to 
transform India’s economy. The government starts tearing down trade 
barriers, giving markets more freedom, and welcoming foreign 
investment.</p>
<p><b><h4>The Harshad Mehta Wave: The Stock Market Tsunami of '91-
'92</h4></b></p><br>
<p><b><h4>The Rise of the “Big Bull”</h4></b></p>
<p>In the midst of this stock market boom stands Harshad Mehta, a man 
larger than life. Known as the “Big Bull,” Mehta has the power to 
move the market with his strategic maneuvers.</p>
<p><b><h4>Mehta’s Master Plan</h4></b></p>
<p>Mehta’s game plan involves a mix of clever tactics, market 
manipulation, and financial engineering. His infamous strategy, 
“circular trading,” involves artificially inflating the prices of 
select stocks by creating a cycle of buying and selling among 
interconnected entities. This creates an illusion of demand and 
liquidity in the market.</p>
<p><b><h4>The Bubble Bursts</h4></b><br></p>
<p><b><h4>The Downfall of Mehta and the Market 
Correction</h4></b></p>
<p>Just as quickly as it rose, the stock market bubble burst. The 
revelation of Mehta’s manipulative practices sent shockwaves through 
the market. Investors panicked, selling off their stocks and leading 
to widespread losses. Mehta’s empire crumbled, and he found himself 
in the middle of legal battles and investigations.</p>
<p><b><h4>The Aftermath - Regulatory Reforms</h4></b><br></p>
<p><b><h4>Strengthening Oversight</h4></b></p>
<p>The Harshad Mehta scandal was a wake-up call for the regulatory 
authorities. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) 
stepped up, introducing stricter surveillance mechanisms, enhancing 
disclosure requirements, and implementing punitive measures against 
market manipulators. The goal was clear - restore faith and integrity 
in the capital markets.</p>
<p><b><h4>The Final Act: Lessons Learned</h4></b></p>
<p>The stock market surge of 1991-1992, marked by the meteoric rise 
of the BSE Sensex, was a reflection of India’s economic 
liberalization and the exuberance of investors. However, it was also 
marred by the manipulative practices of Harshad Mehta, highlighting 
the pitfalls of unchecked speculation and market manipulation. The 
aftermath of the Mehta scandal led to a period of introspection and 
reform, resulting in a strengthened regulatory framework and a 
renewed commitment to transparency and integrity in the Indian 
financial system. As India continues its journey towards economic 
growth and prosperity, the lessons learned from the tumultuous events 
of the early 1990s serve as a reminder of the importance of vigilance 
and prudence in safeguarding the integrity of the capital markets. 
So, as we look back at this rollercoaster ride, we’re reminded that 
while the thrill of the climb is exhilarating, the fall can be steep. 
But every fall gives us the opportunity to learn, grow, and maybe, 
just maybe, climb a little higher next time. </p><br>
