<h4>2.Gen X(Age 36 – 55):</h4>
<p>People from Generation X, who are often busy with their jobs and 
taking care of their families, usually prefer to be careful when it 
comes to investing their money. They might look into stocks and 
mutual funds to increase their wealth, but they often choose their 
investments based on how safe they are, how easily they can get their 
money back, and how it will benefit them in the long run. They also 
like to invest in real estate because it’s something they can 
physically own and it helps them save money for when they retire.</p>
<h4>3.Baby Boomers ( 56 and above): </h4>

keeping their wealth safe than trying to make it grow quickly, so 
they often choose investments that don’t change much in value.</p>
<h4>year wise growth trends:</h4>
<h4>1.Gold Investments :</h4>
<p> In India, gold has always been a key part of investment 
strategies, appreciated for its ability to protect against inflation 
and economic instability. Even though demand for gold can change from 
time to time,the overall trend shows that gold prices have been 
steadily increasing. This is influenced by things like the state of 
the global economy, political tensions around the world, and changes 
in the value of currencies. In the last ten years, the value of gold 
has climbed ,Starting at an average of Rs. 28,006.50 for 24 karat per 
10 grams in 2014, the price soared to Rs. 63,610.00 by 2024. </p>
<h4>2. Real Estate Investments:</h4>
<p>Over the past decade, real estate prices in India have seen a 
steady increase. For instance, the average house price has risen by 
about 6% each year over the past 20 years². However, this trend 
varies across different regions. Some cities have seen much higher 
growth rates, while others have experienced relatively little change 
in house prices². Despite occasional market fluctuations, the longterm trend indicates a consistent rise in real estate prices, 
suggesting a positive outlook for this investment sector.</p>
<h4>3.Equity Markets:</h4>
<p> Since the early 1990s, the Indian equity markets, including the 
BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty, have shown remarkable growth. This growth, 
driven by economic reforms, corporate earnings, and investor 
sentiment, has seen the Sensex rise from around 22,000 in 2014 to 
over 73,000 in 2024. Despite short-term volatility, equities have 
historically offered higher returns,Making them an attractive option 
for long term wealth creation.However, they also carry higher risk, 
so investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment 
goals carefully. </p>
<h4>4.Mutual Funds:</h4>
<p> Mutual funds and SIPs have become favoured investment choices due 
to their diversification and expert management. The sector’s 
expansion is propelled by regulatory changes, heightened investor 
knowledge, and tech innovations. Notably, the ICICI Prudential Value 
Discovery Fund and the HSBC Value Fund have offered remarkable CAGR 
returns of 19.84% and 15.28%, respectively, showcasing mutual funds’ 
capacity for substantial long-term wealth growth.</p>
<h4>5. Stocks and Trading:</h4>
<p>The Indian stock market has seen a surge in trading, largely due 
to the rise of various online trading apps like grow, upstox,angel 
one,etc. These apps have made investing more accessible to a wider 
audience, offering options to trade in stocks, mutual funds, and 
more. They provide comprehensive platforms with advanced tools for 
portfolio analysis and seamless trading. This revolution in trading 
has attracted a diverse range of investors, contributing to the 
exponential growth in trading activity.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The way people in India invest their money has changed a lot over 
time. It’s a mix of old traditions, new ideas, and what people 
prefer. People can choose from many different things to invest in, 
like gold, houses, stocks, and mutual funds. These choices depend on 
how much risk they want to take, how long they plan to invest for, 
and what they want to achieve. As technology changes the way we 
invest, it’s important for people to keep learning, adapt to changes, 
and ask for professional advice if they need it. By being open to new 
ideas and spreading their investments, people can handle changes in 
the market and do well financially in the long run.</p>
